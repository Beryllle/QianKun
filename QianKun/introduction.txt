How to use:
The home page features three functional buttons from left to right: drawing lots、divination,、meditation.

Drawing Lots:
After clicking the "drawing lots" button, you will see an explanation of the drawing lots feature. 
Next, click "start draw lots" to watch an animation of shaking the lot container, after which a lot stick will fall out. 
You can then click "result" to view the lot's interpretation. 
From there, you can either select "re draw lots" to try again or return to the home page by clicking "back" in the top left corner.

Divination:
Return to the home page and click the "divination" button to enter the question submission phase. 
Type your question in English, then input three groups of three-digit numbers below. 
These numbers will be used by the AI to analyze and predict your question based on the principles of the Chinese I Ching (Eight Trigrams). 
After clicking "view results," wait a few seconds to receive the prediction. You can press "translate" to convert the Chinese prophecy into English. 
Once complete, you can click on the blank area outside the pop-up to return to the question page.

Meditation:
Go back to the home page and click the "meditation" button. 
You will see a slowly burning incense burner and a traditional Chinese wooden fish (a percussion instrument often seen in temples). 
In Chinese culture, tapping the wooden fish is believed to accumulate merit and bring good fortune.
